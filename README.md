- Hi, I’m @MollyKressler
- I'm interested in behavioural ecology and Bayesian spatiotemporal models!
- My study species is the Bimini juvenile lemon shark, and my work is conducted at the Bimini Biologicl Field Station, on Bimini, The Bahamas. 
- I'm currently learning about spatial analysis, and Gaussian Markov Random Fields. And I'm always looking to collaborate with behavoural ecologists interested in the marine environment. 
- The best way to reach me is by email! kressler.molly@gmail.com - please have an informative subject line though! Otherwise I might miss your message.
